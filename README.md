# Next.js Noon Frontend Task

## Overview

This project is a simple, responsive single-page application built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Styled Components. It features two main pages:

1. **Home Page**: Displays a list of posts.
2. **Favorites Page**: Displays a list of favorited posts.

Users can mark posts as favorites, which are stored in local storage, and view them on the Favorites page.

## Features

-   **Client-Side Rendering**: Data is fetched and managed entirely on the client side.
